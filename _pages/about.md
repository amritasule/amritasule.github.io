I am a Research Scientist at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, leading single-cell genomics initiatives for the developmental GTEx (dGTEx) project. My research focuses on understanding cellular heterogeneity and developmental trajectories across pediatric development through cutting-edge single-cell and spatial transcriptomics approaches.

At the Broad, I establish and optimize protocols for single-cell multiome analyses across diverse human and non-human primate tissue types. Working collaboratively with research groups across multiple institutions, my work advances our understanding of developmental biology and tissue-specific regulatory landscapes—generating datasets that capture the molecular signatures of development from infancy through adolescence.

Prior to joining the Broad, I completed postdoctoral training at Yale University School of Medicine, where I investigated therapeutic vulnerabilities in oncometabolite-producing cancers. As principal investigator of AACR-AstraZeneca START grant, I identified synergistic DNA repair inhibitor combinations for targeting IDH1/2 mutant cancers—work that was recognized as an Editor's Choice publication in NAR Cancer.

During my PhD at Virginia Commonwealth University, I contributed to the preclinical development of brain-penetrant ATM inhibitors AZD1390 and AZ32, which advanced into Phase I clinical trials for glioblastoma patients. My doctoral research elucidated novel DNA damage response signaling pathways, including the discovery of the ATM-PP2A-Aα regulatory axis.
